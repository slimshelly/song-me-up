# cs0320 Term Project 2018

**all ideas approved** I would also add features to your dj application, but it's a solid idea. -adehovit

**Team Members:**
Maddie Becker, Sam Oliphant, Shell Yang, and Thomas Vandermillen

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:** 

Strengths: Systems programming, OOP, HTML, CSS, Humor

Weaknesses: Javascript, using libraries, connecting backend to frontend efficiently

**Project Idea(s):**

1) What problems do these ideas attempt to solve?
2) How your project will solve them?
3) What critical features you will need to develop, why are those features are being included, and what will you expect to be the most challenging about each feature?

🔥Signmeup/song requester for parties 🔥
1) So often, DJs at a party aren’t aware of the music tastes of the crowd, and do a poor job at stirring excitement. It’s also terribly difficult to scream in the DJ’s ear and tell them what you want to hear next. 
2) With a music requester, attendees can “Sign me up” their songs. DJ’s can “claim ticket” or “delete ticket” if they support or feel repelled by a particular requester’s music taste. You also don’t want all those crew boys requesting “Mr. Brightside” every 5 minutes. However, to counteract those mean DJ’s, if enough people request the same song, it will have to be played.
3) Some critical features are...
  - Receiving and updating the song requests in real time, managing concurrency threads 
  - Joining the server of polling data from different devices
  - Location sharing
  - Visualizing the music that is requested - maybe pulling information on the song and having an interactive interface for both the DJ and the requesters.
