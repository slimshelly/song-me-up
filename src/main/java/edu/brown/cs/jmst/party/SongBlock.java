/**
 * The basis for selecting songs to play. Exactly 3 should exist simultaneously.
 * The lifecycle of a SongBlock has three parts:
 * 1. partygoers add song suggestions
 * 2. partygoers vote on songs added in step 1. Suggestions with sufficiently
 *      negative votes are removed entirely
 * 3. the top X songs are played in an order determined by a sorting algorithm
 *      designed to optimize the consecutive ordering of songs. Suggestions not
 *      played during this step are transferred to the suggestion set of the
 *      next song block, but the number of (positive) votes on the suggestion
 *      decreases (perhaps inversely proportional to amount of votes already
 *      accumulated so that less popular suggestions decay more rapidly)
